# morph-graphql-server-pesy-template

> Note: This is a template and since it contains template variables, it cannot be used on it's own.

This template can be used to get up and running quickly with [`Morph`](https://github.com/reason-native-web/morph).

To bootstrap a application with this template run the following:

Install [`esy`](https://esy.sh) and [`pesy`](https://github.com/esy/pesy) from `npm`.

```sh
npm -g install esy
npm -g install pesy@0.5.0-alpha.18
```

Then create a project folder, cd into that folder and create the project from this template.

```sh
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
pesy --template=reason-native-web/morph-graphql-server-pesy-template
```
