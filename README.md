# pesy-reason-template

This the template used by pesy to bootstrap Reason projects. Since it contains template variables, it cannot be used on it's own.

If you are looking for a template repo to bootstrap your Reason project, you can

1. Try [pesy](https://github.com/esy/pesy), or
2. Fork [hello-reason](https://github.com/esy-ocaml/hello-reason)
